# AoC2021
Programs for Advent of Code 2021
Warning: contains quickly written code that has not been mostly cleaned and refactored.


## How to use
Enter the number for the day you want to run, and enter the input. Once you do that, type in "end".
You can paste the input if your terminal allows it.  
For CMD: Right click the top bar and select Edit>Paste

Or if you're one of those piping types you can put your input in a text file in a format like this:  
```
1
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
end
2
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc
end

To use this with batch, do `type input.txt | AoC2021.exe`  
This will run the first three programs.  
Be sure to keep in the last newline.
